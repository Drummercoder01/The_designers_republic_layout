      <h1>ABOUT</h1>

      <h2>Music</h2>

      <p>The Designers Republic (tDR for short) is a graphic design studio based in Sheffield, England, founded in 1986 by Ian Anderson and Nick Phillips. They are best known for electronic music logos and album artwork and their anti-establishment aesthetics, which embrace brash consumerism and the uniform style of corporate brands. Work by tDR is held in the permanent collections of <a href="http://www.moma.org/" target="_blank">MoMA</a> and the <a href="http://www.vam.ac.uk/" target="_blank">V&A</a>.</p>

      <h2>Closed</h2>

      <p>The studio in its larger form closed in January 2009, with Anderson stating that it would continue in a more 'slimline' form.</p>

      <h2>Style</h2>

      <p id="par3">Work by the Designers Republic is often playful and bright, and considered Maximum-minimalist, mixing images from Japanese anime and subvertised corporate logos, with a postmodern tendency towards controversial irony. It often features statements/slogans.</p>
